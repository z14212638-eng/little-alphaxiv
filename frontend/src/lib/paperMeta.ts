// Ensure a cached Paper record carries real arXiv metadata (title, authors,
// abstract, DOI, published, primary category) — not a bare-id stub.
//
// Why this exists: a paper opened by *direct URL navigation* (a bookmark, a
// refresh, an external link) has no search-result record to seed IndexedDB
// with. PaperView's text-extraction path used to fall back to
// `title = arxivId` with empty authors/abstract/DOI, and that stub is what the
// Zotero "Add to Zotero" flow then sent on — producing a Zotero item whose
// title was the arxiv id and every other field blank. `ensurePaperMeta` fetches
// the real metadata from arXiv (via /api/paper) and merges it into the cached
// record, preserving any already-extracted full_text / oa_pdf_url.
//
// Used by PaperView (load + text-extract) and ZoteroPanel (before adding), so
// the fix is shared instead of duplicated. Best-effort: on any fetch failure
// the existing cached record is returned unchanged.
